# Code Climate RubyMotion Engine

`codeclimate-rubymotion` is a Code Climate engine for [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) projects. You can run it on your command line using the Code Climate CLI, or on our hosted analysis platform.

RubyMotion lets you develop cross-platform native apps for iOS, Android and OS X, all using your favorite editor and Ruby.

### Installation

1. If you haven't already, [install the Code Climate CLI](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate).
2. Run `codeclimate engines:enable rubymotion`. This command both installs the engine and enables it in your `.codeclimate.yml` file.
3. You're ready to analyze! Browse into your project's folder and run `codeclimate analyze`.
